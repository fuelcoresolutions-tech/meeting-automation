## 6. IDS (IDENTIFY, DISCUSS, SOLVE)

### Issue 1: Revenue Target Needs Revision

**ISSUE:** The original 1 Billion revenue target does not reflect the true potential of 200 fuel pump sales.
**ROOT CAUSE:** Initial target was conservative and did not focus exclusively on core strength (pump sales).
**DISCUSSION:** Counsel Bob presented the revised calculation - 200 pumps at minimum 18M each = ~3.6B. Maintenance and construction revenues excluded to maintain strategic focus per Hormozi's framework.
**SOLUTION:** Change it - Revise annual revenue target to **4 Billion**, driven purely by pump sales.
**TO-DO(S):**
- Update strategic plan with 4B revenue target | Owner: Counsel Bob | Due: Feb 18, 2026

---

### Issue 2: Organizational Structure Needs Finalization

**ISSUE:** Organizational organogram and role definitions need team review and buy-in.
**ROOT CAUSE:** Structure was drafted but not yet reviewed by all team members.
**DISCUSSION:** Counsel Bob walked through the organogram:
- **CEO** -> Reports to Board of Directors
- **Direct Reports to CEO:** Finance Manager (CFO), COO, Sales Manager, IT & Systems Specialist, Office Administrator
- **Under CFO:** Accounts Assistant
- **Under COO:** Service & Maintenance Manager -> Dispatch Engineer -> Field Technicians; Parts & Distribution Manager -> Warehouse Staff
- **Under Sales Manager:** Sales Representatives, Market Specialist
- **Under IT:** IT Support Technician

CEO Key Responsibilities:
1. Set overall strategic direction and vision
2. Lead leadership team and ensure department alignment
3. Establish and monitor company-wide performance metrics and financial targets

**SOLUTION:** Share document for async review; discuss KPI feedback at next meeting.
**TO-DO(S):**
- Review CEO responsibilities and KPIs document and provide feedback | Owner: All Team Members | Due: Feb 18, 2026

---

### Issue 3: Meeting Logistics & Remote Participation

**ISSUE:** Key team members (Lawrence, Mikhail) cannot attend in-person; meeting link had no "join" option.
**ROOT CAUSE:** PAL platform does not support Teams meetings; original invite sent without a working join link.
**DISCUSSION:** Robert identified that Lexa Group has Teams capability while PAL does not. Agreed to create new link via Lexa Group. Consensus to hold follow-up meetings online to accommodate everyone.
**SOLUTION:** Change it - Switch to online meetings; create proper Teams links via Lexa Group.
**TO-DO(S):**
- Create new Teams meeting link via Lexa Group | Owner: Robert | Due: Feb 11, 2026
- Forward corrected meeting link to all participants | Owner: Counsel Bob | Due: Feb 11, 2026
